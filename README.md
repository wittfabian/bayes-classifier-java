# Programming assignment Naive Bayes Classifier
A program that classifies the "car data" with a Naive Bayes Classifier

# Run the program

To run the program you only have to save a file with the data as txt in the same directory as the bayesClassifier.jar (like the cardata.txt) and start the program with the following command in the command line:

java -jar bayesClassifier.jar cardata.txt outfile.html

# Output

If the run of the program was successful it generates an output file and saves it to the same directory.

In the file you will see the confusion matrix for one single run (but its the average over 100 runs with x-validation). Additionally you find the percentage of the correct classified test examples (one third of the hole input data).
